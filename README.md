# Dictionary Application - Project Summary

This dictionary application is a web-based front-end implementation built using React and Typescript. The application uses a comprehensive English word list and provides users with a powerful tool to search, filter, and explore the English language.

## Implementation

The dictionary application features a user-friendly interface where users can view a scrollable list of English words. The word list is loaded from a JSON file that is stored locally on the server, allowing for efficient data retrieval.

The dictionary implements response streaming to ensure that the user interface is rendered as quickly as possible. This technique means that the user can start interacting with the dictionary immediately, without having to wait for the full list of words to load. This streaming technique provides a significant boost to the perceived performance of the application.

To support efficient searching through the vast list of words, the application uses a data structure known as a PATRICIA tree. This specific type of search tree is highly efficient for lookups and allows for fast filtering of the word list based on the user's search terms.

The application also supports wildcard search terms. By using an asterisk ( * ) in the search field, users can find words that contain any character in the wildcard's place. For instance, searching for 'c*t' will return words such as 'cat', 'cot', 'cut', etc.

## Persistence

One key feature of the dictionary application is its ability to maintain state between browser refreshes. If a user filters the word list and then refreshes the browser, the application will remember the previous state and present the same filtered list of words.

## UI/UX Design

The design of the dictionary application is intentionally simple and user-friendly, allowing users to focus on their search and exploration of the word list. The layout and visual design of the application are customizable, making it a perfect starting point for a more customized or branded application.

## Technologies

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and built with React and TypeScript, enabling efficient development and strong type-checking. The application's data handling utilizes a local JSON file, and the layout is managed by a third-party virtual list component to efficiently render the long list of words.
